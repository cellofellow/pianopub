PianoPub

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cellofellow/pianopub.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cellofellow/pianopub)

PianoPub aspires to be a shared jukebox for a LAN environment such as an
office. It will allow playing of Pandora radio stations and a locally stored
library with MPD. Any changes to what is currently playing requires a vote
process to initiate.

It will use a websocket backend coupled with an AngularJS frontend. Currently
only some of the bare basics are covered.
